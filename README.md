## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ralph Mouawad, and I am currently a graduate student at Institut Polytechnique de Paris. I am pursuing the M2 Data Science which is directed by Ecole Polytechnique, #1 engineering school in France. 
I also hold a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and a minor in Data Science from the American University of Beirut. There, I focused on AI and Operations Research:
- Optimization: I took part in implementing algorithms to solve ML problems, and engaged in a research project in theoretical optimization for min-max problems.
- Artificial Intelligence: I worked on projects that range from predictive analytics, to computer vision, natural language processing and graph analytics.

I also collaborated with CMA CGM Digital Hub on developing a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to generate employee schedules, which was the most impactful project I have worked on in the past. 
Currently, I am pursuing advanced studies in machine learning at Polytechnique, after which I aim to work in the field. I'm mainly interested to apply my skills in optimization and AI in fields like quantitative finance, supply chain or retailing.
